            <h1>Buddha Canvas</h1>
            <p>This was a project I had in mind for years and then I finially purchased a Cricut machine. The original
                idea I had was to get 4 canvases to make up the entire image. Once I did that I wanted to try it out in
                black and gold. I love how it came out!</p>
            <br>
            <p>The black pictures shown here were the different variataions in trial and error and their outcomes. On
                the far left I added a matte modge podge before I put the image on. 2nd from the right, I smeared the
                paint a bit, and on the far right I added a lotus flower. I also messed around with the sizing on some
                of them.

            <h1>Mini Basketball Tree</h1>
            <p>Around Christmas of 2021 I came across a video on tiktok of a guy who purchased basketballs and glued
                them
                together to form a tree. The idea looked like fun to make. Basketballs are actually expensive and I was
                not
                desiring a full size baskebtball tree for myself. This last year (2022) I purchased mini foam
                basketballs
                and made a mini tree.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Suprisingly it was more difficult than I thought it would be to put fuse these foam together. In the
                video they guy showed himself using a glue gun. I highly doubt this stuck in the long run but perhaps
                there is a
                special gorilla glue he was using and did not share. I bought and tried so many different types of glue
                and none worked except for . . . NAIL GLUE!</p>
            <br>
            <p>This was how far I got in this project. I was trying to add color lights to it. I bought the led string
                lights. With all the extra wiring between lights, it got complicated finding the best way to wrap it
                without
                all the wiring messing up the aesthitics.</p>

        <div id="flwrb">
            <h1>Flower Shadow Box</h1>
            <p>This was a lot of fun! My Cricut cutting machine was used to find and cut out different sizes and
                patterns of flowers. The patterns start out as sprials and then form a flower once they are rolled up.

            <p>My best friends daughter was turning 1 so I made this for her room. I figured they could use it for a
                while and I wouldn't be adding to the pile of toys she would be getting at her party.</p>

            <h1>Play Kitchen</h1>
            <p>My son loves to help out in the kitchen and also to pretend with his toys. At the time he had a play
                tool workshop that he was using as his kitchen. So I got him the <a

                    Play Kitchen</a> and spruced it up for his Christmas present. </p>
            <br>
            <p>For this project, everything that
                could have gone wrong, did. It was still enjoyable even if I ran into all the roadblocks. I painted it a
                bluish green color called Dark
                Night, stuck butcher block vinyl on the counter top as well as the top shelf. I tried to make it look
                like a floating shelf holding the microwave. The microwave and oven were spray painted platinum. I added
                drawer knobs above the oven as dials for the sove top and oven and added subway tile vinyl to a piece of
                foam board and glued that to the back for the backsplash. There is a puck light under the microwave and
                I also made him oven mits, and felt strawberries and of course added the finishing touches with pots,
                pans, and play food. </p>
