                <p>His name is pronounced just like the Taj Mahal. He grows like a weed, challenges my trauma, and is
                    the
                    reason I work on myself every day. His favorite things are vacuums and first responder vehicles.</p>
                <p>Luckily for me I wanted a boy but changed my mind only because I wanted a mini me who looked like me.
                    I got the best of both worlds. He's my spitting image!</p>

                <p>Amara Doggy aka Amara D or Booga Belly was my very first dog. Growing up we had cats. While I enjoy
                    them, I have always been more of a dog person. Booga Belly was given to me as a birthday gift when
                    she was only 7 weeks old. Unfortunately she passed in 2014 but she changed my life forever. She was
                    a husky pit bull mix. I still love her so much and while I would love another dog it will have to
                    wait until a better time. </p>

                <p>My Mom adopted Beau from a shelter after our previous cat Pookie passed away. He is the definition of
                    "scaredy-cat". His motto: If I fits, I sits. </p>
