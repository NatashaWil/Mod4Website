            <p>This was my first mountain!! Plus I hiked it solo! I read Mt. Ellinor was a good beginner mountain if you
                wanted to start climbing mountains. I knew I wasn't in the best of shape and had no idea what I was
                doing. I also knew, how else was I going to learn? Originally, my plan was to begin hiking at 3:00 AM so
                I could be at the top in time for sunrise. When I got there, however, it was so DARK, I waited until I
                could see the outline of the trees.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It took me longer to get up than it did to get down and it was exhausting! On the way down my legs were
                shaking with each step. I'm pretty sure there were murder hornets buzzing around me (I did report them),
                the sound of the bugs in the beginning sounded like I was listening to a soundtrack of a bee hive, and
                every time I thought I was almost to the top, I was humbly reminded I was not. I am so proud of myself
                for completing this hike, it was worth the challenge.</p>

            <p>Several years before this moment I decided to go skydiving. It took me 2 years just to decided I was
                willing to try it. I hate that it took so long to happen but not that I did it. At first I was trying to
                get people to go with me. Managing to find people serious enough to do it was a challenge in itself.
                Even on this day, I went solo. Finally had enough of waiting. Best choice ever!</p>

            <p>Seahawks vs Arizona Cardinals. This was both of our first football game in Washington. The entire time my
                son kept asking when we were going to leave. His favorite part was probably getting dip n dots ice cream
                and all the snacks we ate. I enjoyed the special treatment that comes with having a kiddo. </p>

            <p>Glass Beach starts out as a sandy beach and quickly turns to rocky rubble the rest of the way.
                Out-and-back I believe it is a 5.5 mile trip. If you don't pay attention to the tide you can get stuck
                and if you're not prepared for the rocky treck it can be a long and tiring journey. This particular
                adventure I went alone because well, traveling with a toddler is not ideal. I made it to the end!
                Although I came looking for glass (and found some!) I came across far more interesting things. Like this
                starfish and the old driftwood tree stump. </p>
