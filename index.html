            <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi!

                I’m Tasha, 
                <br>
                I grew up in a military family and have yet to find a place I call home. I moved to Bremerton 4 years ago and I plan on leaving after graduation (destination: to be determined). This is my second quarter here at OC but I have a few transfer credits from Colorado. I am working towards my AAS-T in IT – software development. The IT field is all new to me. I have taken the last year off from working to spend time on myself. In that time there were a lot of aptitude tests that all had software developer in my top results. I decided to try it out because the potential for future job and financial security, as well as control over my time, looks promising. However, my main objective is to learn. Learn new skills and explore areas that may be of interest to me. This leads me to my dreams, interests, and hobbies. I am still trying to figure it out! I am creative and enjoy making the creations in my head a reality (I like arts and crafts). I want to learn graphic design for this reason and sometimes I wonder about being an art director. As for other interests, I like to be outside, go to the gym, and find fun hands-on activities to do. Over the summer this included things like hiking my first mountain, skydiving, building the Lego Taj Mahal, and exploring my bucket list locations in Washington. My dream is to find my passion, be part of a community/ team, have amazing friends, learn all the things I want to know, explore the world, and live off passive income.</p>
