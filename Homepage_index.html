        <p>This is Beau. He is ten years old, cross-eyed and a scaredy cat. He will run from doorbells,
            loud noises, people attempting to pet him, and more. He enjoys playing with plastic, laying on paper and
            sitting on bags.</p>

        <h3>Some of Beau's <em>Lovely</em> Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Meow for attention but run away when you try to give it to him</li>
            <li>Brush up against your legs when you wear black pants</li>
            <li>Sit on laundry fresh out of the dryer (before you can fold it)</li>
            <li>Knock over all my plants</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Beau's Nicknames</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bil-Beau Baggins</li>
            <li>Bo Shmo</li>
            <li>Beau Cat Shmo Cat</li>
            <li>Fat Cat</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I love Beau. I wish he was more of a cuddley cat but he's still sweet in his own stand-offish way. This last
            Christmas I got him a new brush as a present. I spent an entire day <a href="/PawBox.html"> making a box</a>
            in the shape of a paw print to wrap it in. He didn't care. </p>

        <p>One day I want to get a new pet to introduce what I consider to be normal pet behavior. Then I could create a
            new website titled <b>Beau &amp; New Pet</b>. Until then it's just Beau Shmo</p><br>
